## Risks and mitigations

**Risk:** If it takes time to identify/schedule research participants, this could reduce our potential impact.  
**Mitigation:** We press hard for contacts/interviews but move forward with other work in the meantime.

**Risk:** Time is, by design, short. This engagement can go many ways as we define our eventual scope.  
**Mitigation:** Team to commit to a path early on and dig in. Partner accepts that the work done will not be a comprehensive review of everything that is possible.

**Risk:** Important concerns go unaddressed until they swell into larger problems.  
**Mitigation:** Surface obstacles and anxieties early so we can address them as they arise.
