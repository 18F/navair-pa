# U.S. Navy Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Path Analysis 

## Welcome!
This repository contains documentation describing the Navy Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Path Analysis engagement. It is intended to be a place where project team members, stakeholders, and other interested parties can keep track of goals, context, and resources as we work together. 

## History

### NAVAIR

#### Overview

Established in 1966 as the successor to the Navy’s Bureau of Naval Weapons, NAVAIR is headquartered in Patuxent River, Md., with military and civilian personnel stationed at eight locations across the continental United States and one site overseas.

#### Vision

**Sailors and Marines Armed with Confidence**

NAVAIR develops, delivers, and sustains aircraft, weapons, and systems – on time, on cost, with proven capability and reliability – so they succeed in every mission and return safely home.

#### Mission

NAVAIR's mission is to provide full life-cycle support of naval aviation aircraft, weapons and systems operated by Sailors and Marines. This support includes research, design, development and systems engineering, acquisition, test and evaluation, training facilities and equipment, repair and modification, and in-service engineering and logistics support.


#### Focus areas

**Increase Speed to the Fleet** through program of record planning and execution, and rapid response to urgent warfighter needs
 
**Consistently Deliver Integrated & Interoperable Warfighting Capabilities** (platforms, sensors and weapons operating seamlessly in a systems of systems environment) that produce an immediate and sustainable increase in warfighting effectiveness
 
**Improve Affordability** by reducing operating and sustainment costs for fielded systems and implementing life-cycle cost reduction initiatives as part of new systems development


#### Competencies and Program Executive Offices

NAVAIR is organized into eight "competencies" or communities of practice including: program management, contracts, research and engineering, test and evaluation, logistics and industrial operations, corporate operations, comptroller and counsel.  NAVAIR provides support (people, processes, tools, training, mission facilities, and core technologies ) to Naval Aviation Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and their assigned program managers, who are responsible for meeting the cost, schedule, and performance requirements of their assigned programs.

### Engagement

NAVAIR HR requires the improvement of both the quality of the data they collect and manage and the use of predictive analytics. Aviation fleet readiness remains challenged with data collection and management resulting in potential reactive postures.  Organized and structured data with appropriate staffing will enhance required predictability.  NAVAIR HR desires a predictive model based on the data available to them allowing them to identify trends in the past and use the data to plan for the future.

18F and NAVAIR began this path analysis engagement on July 30th, 2018, with a kickoff workshop at Naval Air Station Patuxent River on August 9th, 2018. This phase of work is expected to conclude no later than September 30th, 2018.

## Users and stakeholders

 - HR administrators and specialists managing hiring offers
 - Program managers and analysts making hiring requests and managing team size and number necessary for requirements
 - Senior stakeholders overseeing program portfolios
 - NAVAIR data analysts
 - Others TBD (possibly recruiters)




## Our approach 
We will begin by experimenting with predictive analytics in the Fleet Readiness Center in Jacksonville, Florida. We then plan to apply learnings and innovatoins to all major Fleet Readiness Centers (three main centers exist).

In order to do this, we will work collaboratively to review available data to determine the current state of the information, explore the feasibility of modeling it, and develop a preliminary plan/recommendation for how to operationalize/build it out in order to meet NAVAIR’s goals.

We will assist NAVAIR with modern data practices aimed at a comprehensive understanding of their HR data elements. This will expand their ability to model data and thus, predict attrition and hiring needs and retain necessary skill sets and forecast more efficiently. We will use the available data to determine the current state of the information, explore the feasibility of modeling it, and put a preliminary plan/recommendation for how to operationalize/build it out to help NAVAIR determine the best path forward. 


## Planned deliverables

 - Problem definition and potential partner impact: the explicit objectives to achieve NAVAIR goals, based upon an investigation, and the level of impact felt by the organization or its user base
 - Strategy, recommendations, and concept: a stated approach to achieve an outcome based on the organization’s unique position, including but not limited to its mission, context, resources, and risks
 - When appropriate, limited prototypes, wireframes, data, or other documents we will generate



## Project team and roles

### 18F

**T.C. Baxter (Engineering)** Leads data analysis as front and backend developer. Assesses data and data schema to frame possible improvements.

**Andrew Suprenant (Product Manager and Lead)** — Articulates vision for engagement in collaboration with the product owner. Regularly selects work of highest value to be prioritized in sprints. Cultivate alignment of product owner, development team, and key stakeholders. Identifies and works to resolve obstacles. Highlights and works to mitigate risk. Ensures progress moves forward and that the 18F team delivers. 

**Kathryn Connolly (Account Manager)** — Provide support to project team and serves as liaison between NAVAIR and 18F. 

## Risks and mitigations

**Risk:** We are not able to receive responses, decisions, support, resources, and assistance to unblock issues in a timely manner.  
**Mitigation:** Identify and select primary and secondary points of contact who can provide this support quickly throughout the workday during the course of this engagement, with the secondary contact as a fallback mechanism when the primary is unavailable.

**Risk:** We are unable to access data and systems that will be critical to understand the current state at NAVAIR HR, informing this work.  
**Mitigation:** We press hard for access to data and systems we need and call out lack of access as a critical blocking issue. At the same time, we move forward to make the most use of time as possible.

**Risk:** Time is, by design, short. This engagement can go many ways as we define our eventual scope.  
**Mitigation:** Team to commit to a path early on and dig in. Partner accepts that the work done will not be a comprehensive review of everything that is possible.

**Risk:** If it takes time to identify/schedule research participants, this could reduce our potential impact.  
**Mitigation:** We press hard for contacts/interviews but move forward with other work in the meantime.

**Risk:** Important concerns go unaddressed until they swell into larger problems.  
**Mitigation:** Surface obstacles and anxieties early so we can address them as they arise.
