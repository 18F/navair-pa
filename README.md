# U.S. Navy Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Path Analysis 

## Welcome!
This repository contains documentation describing the Navy Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Path Analysis engagement. It is intended to be a place where project team members, stakeholders, and other interested parties can keep track of goals, context, and resources as we work together. 

## NAVAIR

Established in 1966 as the successor to the Navy’s Bureau of Naval Weapons, NAVAIR is headquartered in Patuxent River, Maryland, with military and civilian personnel stationed at eight locations across the continental United States and one site overseas.

### Vision

NAVAIR develops, delivers, and sustains aircraft, weapons, and systems – on time, on cost, with proven capability and reliability – so they succeed in every mission and return safely home.

### Mission

NAVAIR's mission is to provide full life-cycle support of naval aviation aircraft, weapons and systems operated by Sailors and Marines. This support includes research, design, development and systems engineering, acquisition, test and evaluation, training facilities and equipment, repair and modification, and in-service engineering and logistics support.

## Engagement

NAVAIR HR would like to improve the quality of the data they collect and manage through better data modeling to inform the use of predictive analytics. This will allow them to better identify past trends and better plan for the future, strengthening hiring and retention forecasting to better serve Navy and Marine fleets.

18F and NAVAIR began this path analysis engagement on July 30th, 2018, with a kickoff workshop at Naval Air Station Patuxent River on August 9th, 2018. This phase of work is expected to conclude no later than September 30th, 2018.

## Vision for this work

 - Improve forecasting of attrition, retention, and hiring based on personnel needs to keep NAVAIR staffed with the right people with the right skills at the right time
 - Enhance predictability through organized and structured data, using predictive analytics and data modeling to forecast out a five-year plan
 - Develop a local model that can be expanded and rolled over to other areas
 - Develop NAVAIR capacity to grow and extend these practices over time


## Users and stakeholders

 - HR administrators and specialists managing hiring offers
 - Program managers and analysts making hiring requests and managing team size and number necessary for requirements
 - Senior stakeholders overseeing program portfolios
 - NAVAIR data analysts
 - Others TBD (possibly recruiters)


## Our approach 
We will begin by experimenting with predictive analytics in the Fleet Readiness Center in Jacksonville, Florida. We then plan to apply learnings and innovations to all three major FRCs.

For more on our approach, please [visit this page on our approach](https://github.com/18F/navair-pa/blob/master/approach.md).


## Planned deliverables

 - Problem definition and potential partner impact: the explicit objectives to achieve NAVAIR goals, based upon an investigation, and the level of impact felt by the organization or its user base
 - Strategy, recommendations, and concept: a stated approach to achieve an outcome based on the organization’s unique position, including but not limited to its mission, context, resources, and risks
 - When appropriate, limited prototypes, wireframes, data, or other documents we will generate

## Risks and mitigations

**Risk:** We are not able to receive responses, decisions, support, resources, and assistance to unblock issues in a timely manner.  
**Mitigation:** Identify and select primary and secondary points of contact who can provide this support quickly throughout the workday during the course of this engagement, with the secondary contact as a fallback mechanism when the primary is unavailable.

**Risk:** We are unable to access data and systems that will be critical to understand the current state at NAVAIR HR, informing this work.  
**Mitigation:** We press hard for access to data and systems we need and call out lack of access as a critical blocking issue. At the same time, we move forward to make the most use of time as possible.

**Risk:** Time is, by design, short. This engagement can go many ways as we define our eventual scope.  
**Mitigation:** Team to commit to a path early on and dig in. Partner accepts that the work done will not be a comprehensive review of everything that is possible.

**Risk:** If it takes time to identify/schedule research participants, this could reduce our potential impact.  
**Mitigation:** We press hard for contacts/interviews but move forward with other work in the meantime.

**Risk:** Important concerns go unaddressed until they swell into larger problems.  
**Mitigation:** Surface obstacles and anxieties early so we can address them as they arise.
