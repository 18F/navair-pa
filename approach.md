# Approach

To help NAVAIR move into the fields of predictive analytics and deep learning in service of their goals, our 18F team will assist NAVAIR with modern data practices aimed at a comprehensive understanding of their HR data elements. This will expand their ability to model data and thus, predict attrition and hiring needs. 

NAVAIR will then be able to retain necessary skill sets and forecast more efficiently, allowing them to main their fleet and subsequently keep NAVAIR planes in the air. 

In order to do this, we will:
1. Work collaboratively to review available data to determine the current state of the information
2. Think critically about the focus areas and skillsets NAVAIR seeks to hire and retain
3. Select a specific data set where we can quickly experiment and learn
4. Develop possible insights on how to standardize, structure, and model the data in order to understand skill capabilities and gaps 
5. Explore the feasibility of modeling this
6. Develop recommendations for a path forward to meet NAVAIRâ€™s goals (e.g. operationalizing model if feasible, other next steps if not)


## Areas of focus

The following five sections represent prioritized areas related to NAVAIR that we would like to explore as we determine a system modernization path to better meet the needs of users during this engagement and beyond. 
Given our limited time, we almost certainly will not explore any section comprehensively; rather, we will select from these each week as we prioritize our work relative to our capacity.
 - User research
 - Data analysis
 - Systems audit and understanding capabilities (as needed)
 - Process review (as needed)
 - Findings and recommendations


## First steps

To improve the quality and utility of the data NAVAIR collects and manages, we will explore using predictive analytics in the Southeast Fleet Readiness Center in Jacksonville, Florida. Any learnings could then be expanded upon both in the Jacksonville location and to all three main FRCs.
