# Approach

To help NAVAIR move into the fields of predictive analytics and deep learning, our 18F strategists and engineers will assist NAVAIR with modern data practices aimed at a comprehensive understanding of their HR data elements. This will expand their ability to model data and thus, predict attrition and hiring needs. They will be able to retain necessary skill sets and forecast more efficiently. This will allow them to main their fleet and subsequently keep NAVAIR planes in the air. 



In order to do this, we will:
1. Work collaboratively to review available data to determine the current state of the information
2. Select a specific data set where we can quickly experiment and learn
3. Explore the feasibility of modeling it
4. Develop a preliminary plan/recommendation for how to operationalize/build it out in order to meet NAVAIRâ€™s goals


## Areas of focus

The following five sections represent prioritized areas related to AFRISS-TF that we would like to explore as we determine a path to modernize the system to better meet the needs of its users during this engagement and beyond. 
Given our limited time, we almost certainly will not explore any section comprehensively; rather, we will select from these each week as we prioritize our work relative to our capacity.
 - User research
 - Data analysis
 - Systems audit and understanding capabilities (as needed)
 - Process review (as needed)
 - Findings and Recommendations
